                My summer internship in 2024 took place at Z_GIS (University of Salzburg - Department of Geoinformatics), where I gained an insight into the world of GIS and scientific research. The aim of the internship was to actively participate in the preparation of scientific articles related to ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) regulations and deforestation, as well as to support project management tasks. This report summarizes my activities, knowledge and experience during the internship.

            Main responsibilities and experience</p>
            <p class="blog-text"> 
            During my internship, I worked in several closely related areas. One of my most important tasks was the creation of geovisualizations and illustrations for scientific articles. While creating these figures, I became more familiar with Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Express and mastered the visual requirements for scientific publications.

            <p class="blog-text">
            Another area of focus was the study of the structure of scientific articles. This included a deeper understanding of the research topics, with a particular focus on ESG regulations, European Union requirements and how Earth Observation (EO) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) support these processes. During the internship, I was convinced that these topics are closely related to my interests, especially the issue of sustainability and deforestation.

            We were welcomed by Dr. Gebhard Banko and Dr. Roland Gillmayer, two experts who generously shared their knowledge and some details about their work with us. Their presentation covered the agency’s mission, ongoing projects, and its role within the wider European environmental infrastructure. The tone was engaging and very informative; they clearly had a passion for what they do. One of the main topics discussed was the production of land cover maps using orthophotographic imagery and satellite data. We learned how the agency performs land use classification, distinguishing between forests, urban areas, agricultural land, and water bodies. This work is crucial for supporting the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) and informing EU-wide environmental policies. What stood out to me was the high level of accuracy needed and the extensive validation procedures used to maintain data quality. Since I have worked with CORINE Landcover data before, this was particularly interesting for me.
            The experts also emphasized the role of GIS (Geographic Information Systems) in managing spatial datasets and making them accessible and usable for public authorities. They walked us through real examples of how spatial analysis supports both local and national policy decisions, from air quality control to habitat conservation. A particularly relevant topic for our studies was the discussion on the INSPIRE Directive. This EU initiative aims to standardize how spatial information is collected, shared, and maintained across member states. We learned how UBA and BEV contribute to Austria’s compliance with INSPIRE, facilitating data interoperability and ensuring that various institutions can work with harmonized geospatial datasets. This level of coordination is essential for efficient cross-border environmental cooperation. What struck me most was the level of interdisciplinarity at UBA: ecology, informatics, remote sensing, public administration—all come together under one roof to drive forward data-informed environmental stewardship. It was encouraging to see how research, data, and policy can align when supported by the right institutional frameworks.

            The aim of detailed sustainability reporting is to create a transparent and accountable business environment that promotes sustainable investments and increases corporate responsibility. Companies are increasingly integrating sustainability into their core strategies, in line with the EU’s broader environmental and social goals. Earth Observation and GIS technology have become critical tools for conducting large-scale environmental analyses. EO data is essential for collecting spatial data on land, water and atmosphere, which makes it essential for sustainability compliance reporting, for example under the CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) or the EU Deforestation-Free Products Regulation (EUDR). I was able to see the final stages of these research projects and participate in the final refinements.

            The internship was carried out in a university environment, which was inspiring and supportive. During my daily work, I had a great workstation and the company of my colleagues was also good. Working with Professor Thomas Blaschke was an extremely positive experience. He was responsive, helpful and extremely supportive, set realistic expectations for the tasks and always gave constructive feedback at the end of the tasks. This work dynamic confirmed that freelance work could also be a good fit for me in the future.

            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
            During the internship, I used several software, including Zotero for managing scientific articles and sources, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Express for visualizations, and Microsoft Office applications. Using these tools contributed to my professional development and efficient work.

            The lessons learned during the internship are as follows:
                <li>I delved into the expectations of editing and structuring scientific articles.</li>
                <li>I gained practical experience in creating geovisualizations and illustrations.</li>
                <li>I learned more about ESG regulations and the role of GIS in sustainability reporting.</li>
                <li>I have personal experience with the final stages of scientific research and teamwork.</li>

            </p>
            <p class="blog-text">
            My summer internship at Z_GIS was extremely useful and educational. I not only deepened my professional knowledge, but also gained valuable experience in the fields of scientific research, project management, and teamwork. The time spent here has confirmed the correctness of my chosen career and motivated me to continue learning and developing. I would like to thank you for the opportunity and the support of my professor.
