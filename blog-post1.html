            <h2>Big Data from Space 2023: BiDS</h2>
            <div class="blog-post-content">
                <p>Last year, in November 2023, I followed one of my favorite "passion" and traveled to Vienna for the ESA Big Data from Space conference. The exhibition lasted from November 6 to 9 and all professionals interested were welcome. I have never participated in such a large conference before and this event was very useful and inspiring for me. Many really excellent professionals gave speeches about their work and research, it was really inspiring to see so many people working to save our environment on Earth, so that our planet can remain a livable place for humanity. It was at this conference that I heard about the Copernicus Master's program for the first time, and after this I got the idea that I should apply for the course.</p><br>
